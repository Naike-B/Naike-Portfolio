# <Naike-s-Portfolio>


## Description

This landing page was created for visitors who are looking to hire a web developer. The scope is to provide the visitors with information about me and to showcase the work I've done so far.In particular, the page includes links that will redirect the visitor to the applications I deployed and also my contact details.

Working on this project, I learned more about using flex boxes and grids in CSS and about media queries and how to use them to make a website responsive.
